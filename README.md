<h1>Package Sniffer.</h1>

In this project I wanted to learn about C#, WPF and also how the network works.
I used new librabraries, read a lot of books, had meetings with it professionals.

A difficult project but I also learnt a lot from it.

Packet Capture Logic (Class1.txt): Implements the core functionality for intercepting network packets. This component is responsible for the real-time monitoring of network traffic, efficiently capturing packets as they traverse the network.

Project Configuration (WpfNetworkAnalysisTests.txt): Contains project configuration details, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly integrated and that the application is ready for development and deployment in a Visual Studio environment.
